# Oh, hello there!

Welcome to my fantastic github profile. Hope you like it here.

Who am I? Oh, I am a programmer. Code mostly in python. Do some random stuff,
like libraries that no one ever gonna use, because they have better alternatives.
But thats alright.. I am used to reinventing the wheel.

I also enjoy creating addons for Blender and Godot game engine, like for example [Rena](https://github.com/cmd410/Rena), my biggest project so far which I made to practice writing recursive descent parsers and interpreter but also seems like something useful.
