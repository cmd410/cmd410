# Tu-tu-ru â™ª

Greetings, internet traveler. What you see in front of you is my github profile. 

I am a python programmer, known as Crystal Melting Dot or Crystal or Melting or Dot or cmd for short.

I also once in a while do some art, even though I don't do it as often as I used to... tiring college days as an architect student are getting to me. I'll try to do more in future, just bear with me.

## My places

- This profile

- [My Site](https://cmd410.is-a.dev/)

- [DeviantArt](https://www.deviantart.com/cmd410)

- [Artstation](https://cmd410.artstation.com/)

- Last but not least, my [telegram channel](https://t.me/spacialdot) where I write  random crap once in a while.


## btw...

  _If I somehow succeed in making you a happier person... you know... uhm... you could make me happier as well... If you have some spare coins consider supporting me. You could maybe... I dunno... [buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/cmd410) or maybe maybe even [sponsor me on librepay](https://liberapay.com/CrystalMeltingDot/)... That would be absolutely awesome... But anyway, hope you found what you were looking for, take care, internet traveler_
